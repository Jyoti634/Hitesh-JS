Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

jese hi apne function likha , use turant hi execute karwana he 
There are many ways to do it , and why we need this type of function which will execute immediately 
sometimes , in some project there are some files in which we want database connection first 

and also sometimes in global scope some variables declared and some  functions are declared and
 we don't want function ke andar that global variable creates some problem. 

 so there are this 2 main reason are ,
  we don't want global scope ki baje se function pollute ho that's why we make some scope which will
  immediately invoked.
ex => 
function chai(){
    console.log(`DB CONNECTED`);
}
chai()//DB CONNECTED

- But int his there is no polution , But what is from global scope it starts polluting, 
So to escape from that what we do let's see. 

(function chai(){
    console.log(`DB CONNECTED`);
})()//DB CONNECTED


Syntax of IIFE: 
(Defination of function)(Execution of that function)

Defination of IIFE- Some times problem occuers due to global scope ,
 to get rid of that polution we use IIFE. 

- Let's see how to write the IIFE as an arrow function 

ex=>
(function chai(){
    console.log(`DB CONNECTED`);
})()//DB CONNECTED

(function aurcode(){
    console.log(`DB CONNECTED TWO`)
})()
- This will through error because this immediately invoked function invoked quickly , 
but it doesn;t know where to stop 
due to which we have to explicitly stop it to start another IIFE.
So for that we use semicolon (;) in between 2 function 
to stop 1st function and start another function 


(function chai(){
    console.log(`DB CONNECTED`);
})();//DB CONNECTED

(function aurcode(){
    console.log(`DB CONNECTED TWO`)
})()// DB CONNECTED TWO  

So similarly we use use this in arrow function also , 


(() => {
    console.log(`DB CONNECTED`);
})();//DB CONNECTED

(() => {
    console.log(`DB CONNECTED TWO`)
})()//DB CONNECTED TWO

- But in this also we have to use semicolon in between the statement. 
- We can also pass parameters in IIFE

ex- (() => {
    console.log(`DB CONNECTED`);
})();//DB CONNECTED

((name) => {
    console.log(`DB CONNECTED TWO ${name}`);
})("hitesh")//DB CONNECTED TWO hitesh
