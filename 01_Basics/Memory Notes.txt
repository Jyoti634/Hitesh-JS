2 types of memory are there in JS - 

1. Stack and 
2. Heap 
- Premitive data types mostly used in Stack memory
- Non - premitive datatype mostly used in Heap Memory

- When you use stack memory , whatever variables you have declared you will get a copy of that 
- When you use heap memory , what ever variable you have declared , you will get a reference of original value.


let myName= "Jyoti"
let anotherName = myName
anotherName= "Chaiaurcode"
console.log(myName) //Jyoti
console.log(anotherName)//Chaiaurcode


let userOne = {
    email : "user@google.com",
    upi: "user@ybl"
}
let userTwo = userOne
userTwo.email= "jyoti@google.com"
console.log(userOne.email);//jyoti@google.com due to heap memory
console.log(userTwo.email);//jyoti@google.com due to heap memory
